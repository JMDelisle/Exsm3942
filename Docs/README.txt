Create a Bank draft with client information and client account information. Finished add more data in my Models file. I was having issues where the migration wasn't working, till I had shut down the visual studio and restarted the pc. It all works now and migration successfully completed.

Had gotten the seed data done but upon adding migrations, I am getting an error to which I need to figure out. Upon figuring out there was an extra foreign generated in Xampp which was causing a lot of grief. Had to restart everything and now the only error I am seeing is there an existing accounttype, which I don't know if I need to remove that table or rename it.
